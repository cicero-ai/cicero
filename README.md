Cicero is your self-hosted AI, built in Rust to understand, remember, and handle your digital tasks. Open-source and fiercely private, it locks big tech out, keeping your data and life yours.

General release coming shortly.  For full details and to stay updated, please visit [https://cicero.sh/](https://cicero.sh/).

Sophia NLU Engine is now open source and available within the /src/sophia/ directory of this repository.  Details at:  [https://cicero.sh/sophia/](https://cicero.sh/sophia/).

## Support Cicero

The project currently needs your help.  I need either of these pieces shared:

Serious manifesto:  https://cicero.sh/r/manifesto

Satrical comedy, George Carlin style: https://cicero.sh/r/hows-the-ai-revolution

I have the necessary skills and experience to complete the manifesto with quality, but I can't do this alone.  Help me help the world.
