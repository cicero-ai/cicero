## rustfmt.toml  

The rustfmt.toml   has been configured to retain longer lines, instead of the standard of splitting every chain link onto a new line.

PRs submitted with that configuration removed will be rejected.  I know this will be a pet peeve for some, but I'm blind and maintainer on this project, so that stays as working with tiny lines via screen reader is a nightmare.
